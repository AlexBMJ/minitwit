# WAY Group SLA

## Terminology

- WAY Group INC. will be referred to as 'WG' throughout this document.

## Who We Are

WAY Group INC. consists of a group of young, motivated and aspiring developers, trying to make a change in the world. WAY Group INC. are mostly known for their minitwit application, which has received hundred thousands of tweets from active uesrs.

Our goal is to bring the world closer together by making communication available at the finger tip.

## Uptime & Availability

WG will strive for the highest possible uptime and be available for as long as it can. WG will use latest and modern approved technologies in an attempt to achieve this goal and to rectify any issues that may occur.

Uptime and availability can be found through our internal tracking technologies from Grafana and Prometheus. This can be viewed [here.](https://stats.minitwit.waygroup.net/). Currently only for internal users. Guest accounts can be offered for affected users for validity and transparency of the accusations made.

## Mean Response Time

Based on statistical analysis, WG's mean response time for its minitwit application is less than 1 second. Please note that the client's internet connection, speed, and other factors that is out of our hand is not something we take responsiblity for and into account for the calculation of the statistics.

## Mean Time To Recover

WG's mean recovery time for issues caused, can be expected to be around 1 hour.

## Failure Frequency

WG's minitwit application only had issues during the launch of minitwit (the first few weeks), which WG has decided not to take into account. Since then, minitwit have had no failures and only has small downtime during maintenance.

## Compensation

If down time occurs that is specifically caused by WG, and not an external dependency, compensation will be offered to affected users if the expected recovery time (stated above) has been exceeded.

| Monthly Uptime Percentage | Compensation |
| --- | --- |
| 99% – 99.9% | 5 USD |
| 95% – 99.0% | 50 USD |
| > 95% | 500 USD |

Affected users will have to reach out through the support mail at support@waygroup.net. WG will carefully go through the details of the claim and decided the outcome. If you do not hear back from WG, consider the case closed and the claim invalid. WG's average support ticket response time is ~3 days.
