# WAY Group SLA

## Terminology

- WAY Group INC. will be referred to as 'WG' throughout this document.

## Who We Are

WAY Group INC. consists of a group of young, motivated and aspiring developers, trying to make a change in the world. WAY Group INC. are mostly known for their minitwit application, which has received hundred thouasnds of tweets from thousands of active uesrs.

Our goal is to bring the world closer together by making communication and expression available at the tip of users fingers.

## Uptime & Availability

WG will try its very best to achieve the highest possible uptime and be available for as long as it can. WG will use latest and modern approved technologies in an attempt of achieving this goal and to rectify any issues that may occur in the fastest way possible.

Uptime and availability can be found through our internal tracking technologies from Grafana and Prometheus. This can be viewed [here.](https://stats.minitwit.waygroup.net/). All of this can be viewed here by internal users. Guest accounts can be offered for affected users for validity and transparency of the accusations made.

## Mean Response Time

Based on statistical analysis, WG's mean response time for its MiniTwit application is < 1 second. Please note that the client's internet connection, speed, and other properties that is out of our hand is not something we take responsiblity for and into account for the calculation of those statistics.

## Mean Time To Recover

WG's mean recovery time for issues caused is ~1 hour.

## Failure Frequency

WG's MiniTwit application only had issues in its first couple of weeks, which WG has decided not to take into account. Since then, MiniTwit has had no failures and only has small downtime maintenance periods.

## Compensation

If down time occurs that is specifically caused by WG, and not an external dependency, compensation will be ofered to affected users if the expected recovery time (stated above) has been exceeded.

| Monthly Uptime Percentage | Compensation |
| --- | --- |
| 99% – 99.9% | 5 USD |
| 95% – 99.0% | 50 USD |
| > 95% | 500 USD |

Affected users will have to reach out through the support mail at support@waygroup.net. WG has the last say when claims occur and a reply is not guranteed. WG is, however, proud to publicize that their average support ticket response time is ~3 days.
