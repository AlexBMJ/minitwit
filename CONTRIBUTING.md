# Branching

This repository focuses on the use of branching. Direct commits to the main branch is not possible, and has to be done through pull requests. All pull requests must pass all the tests in order to get accepted, and if new code is added, a unit test must come with it.

# Responsibility

All group members are responsible for reviewing the code. Each pull request must be reviewed by at least someone else in order for it to be merged into the main branch.
